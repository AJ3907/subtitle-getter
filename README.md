# subtitle-getter
Searching for your movie/tv series subtitles???
Are you too lazy like me to search them??
Well here is the solution...Download "get-subtitle.py".

Make sure you have python 2.x installed with "BeautifulSoup" and "requests"

To install "BeautifulSoup" and "requests" modules, first install "pip"
https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/

then add pip in system variables.
pip will be in C://Python27/Scripts/pip.py

then do 
pip install BeautifulSoup
pip install requests

Then all you have to do is:

python get-subtitle.py

It'll prompt you to enter path of the file.
Enter it and voila just double click your media file...subtitle will be incorporated automatically.
